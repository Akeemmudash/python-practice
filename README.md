# Python Practice

Each project is contained in its own file and my attempt to recreate the project is created with the same name and suffixed with \_v2.

# Project Structure

- `bagels.py`
- `bagels_v2.py`
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

# Description of Projects
