# Python Practice

This repository contains small python projects from the book 'THE BIG BOOK OF SMALL PYTHON PROJECTS'.
Each project is contained in its own file and my attempt to recreate the project is created with the same name and suffixed with \_v2.

# Project Structure

- `bagels.py`
- `bagels_v2.py`
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

# Description of Projects

- `bagels.py`: This is the original version of the Bagels game, a number guessing game where the player has to guess a secret number based on clues provided.
- `bagels_v2.py`: This is my attempt to recreate the Bagels game, with possible improvements or changes in the implementation.
- `birthdayparadox.py`: This project simulates the birthday paradox, which is the counterintuitive probability that in a group of people, the chance that at least two people share a birthday is surprisingly high.
- `birthdayparadox_v2.py`: This is my attempt to recreate the birthday paradox simulation, with possible improvements or changes in the implementation.
- `blackjack.py`: This project implements a simple version of the Blackjack card game, where the player plays against the dealer.
