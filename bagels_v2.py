I am thinking of a {}-digit number. Try to guess what it is.
Here are some clues:
When I say:     That means:
    Pico        One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
    Fermi       One digit is incorrect and in the right position.
    Bagels      No digit is correct.
I have thought up a number.
    You have 10 guesses to get it.
